// a list of images that we've got in a folder
// a list of the images we just saw
// a variable for the number of times we've voted (at 25, it stops and ...???)

// a constructor function that turns each image from the list into an object with title etc.
// with a number for total appearances
// with a number for times it got choesn

// a prototype that does
// let each image alter its stats when a vote happens
// and add itself to the list of images we just saw ()

// load images from the list into constructor

// choose a random image
// add to a list of randomly chosen candidate images
// check that random image against the list of just-shown ones
// if it's on the list, get a new candidate
// if it's already on the candidate list, also get a new candidate
// add it to a list of the candidate images

// loop through the candidate images
// create a figure for each

// when I click on a figure
// ++ that ones's total votes
// ++ everyone's total appearances
// wipe out the list of last round
// add everyone to the list of last round
