focus group participant:
- as a focus group participant I want to be presented with three random images so I can pick my favorite
- as a focus group participant I want to be able to click and image and vote on it
- as a focus group participant I want to never see an image that I just voted for, whether up or down
- as a focus group participant I want an explanation on the page of what I'm looking at
- as a focus group participant I want to be able to see the results of what I voted for after 25 votes in the form of '3 votes for the banana slicer'.

Client:
- as a client I want to have a webapp that lets me usertest products I'm considering for my catalog
- as a client I want to see how many times each product has been displayed to focus group participants so I can compare them
- as a client I want to see how many times each product was selected so I can see which products were selected most
- as a client I want to see a list of products that were chosen the highest percentage of the time they were displayed so I can know which items were most popular
- as a client I want to have a page for my usertest to live on that's easy for testers to use

Developer:
- as a developer I want to have clean, nicely commented code so I can build more easily on it in the future
- as a developer I want to use a prototype to make performant instances of the test objects so I can scale this application
- as a developer I want to have single-purpose modular functions that log errors so I can easily debug
- as a developer I want to build my functions so I can potentially send the data I collect out to plugins, an API, or whatever else I need to do with it
- as a developer I want to build this thing fast and efficiently so I can not spent my time refactoring later and instead go to the gym and get some sleep ffs
